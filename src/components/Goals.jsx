            Future Goals: Bridging AI and Medicine for Humanity

            My passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is not just an academic pursuit‚Äîit‚Äôs
            a way to reconnect with my childhood dream of becoming a doctor. Over time, I realized that technology and humanity
            are not opposite ends; instead, technology can enhance and humanize healthcare.

            Long-Term Vision: Intelligent Medical Personal Assistant (IMPA)
          </h2>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-neutral-800">
            My ultimate goal is to build IMPA, a smart system that assists humans in managing both their
            physical and emotional health. IMPA is not just another chatbot‚Äîit will combine the power of
            NLP (Natural Language Processing), Computer Vision, and personalized medical modeling to provide
            empathetic interactions, user condition analysis, and adaptive early medical advice.
