        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed">
          I have had several opportunities to be a workshop speaker, assisting a lecturer in demonstrating an AI project.
          The demo we presented was an intelligent system capable of detecting clothing, designed in response to our campus
          regulations that prohibit wearing shorts or crop tops. This AI project was developed by one of our alumni who
          now works at BCA Digital. The project is certified and has been integrated into a Scopus-indexed journal.

        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed">
          Garuda Hacks is Southeast Asia's largest hackathon, with over 6000 total participants and
          nonprofit dedicated to empowering young Indonesians with the skills and motivation to solve the
          country's most urgent issues. Despite their skill and ideas, many talented programmers lack
          the resources to succeed in the job market. My role in this event was as a Liaison Officer, serving as a point of contact between key
          parties during the event (participants, committee, and judges). I also learned how to communicate
          in a professional environment, including how to explain systems and regulations to the judges. In
          addition, I had the opportunity to learn through direct access to the workshops aligned with this year’s
          track (Connecting Cultures, Sustainability, Education and Equity) and the career fair, which featured many leading companies.

        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed">
          Dicoding is a platform for Indonesian developers to learn, create digital products, gain industry-recognized
          validation for their work, and find job opportunities with partner companies. I studied AI and Machine Learning
          classes here, learning about data preparation, data processing, and how to apply it to AI systems. The course
          also began with the fundamentals—what is AI, the different types and depths of its systems (AI, Machine
          Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI).
